## 1. Project

A **bilingual (Arabic/English), AI-native commercial-contracts workspace** for small Levant law firms (2–10 lawyers). The product makes the contract document itself the workspace — editable, versioned, clause-aware, with AI inline — and explicitly avoids the litigation, accounting, and CRM breadth of competitors (HAQQ.ai, Clio).

**Single hardest test we must pass:** a lawyer imports a real `.docx` contract, edits clauses (mixed AR/EN, RTL/LTR), exports back to `.docx`, and opens the file in Microsoft Word with formatting intact. If round-trip fidelity breaks, the wedge breaks.

**MVP audience:** small commercial-law firms in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq.
**Wedge (PROVISIONAL until Arabic AI test against HAQQ completes):** either Arabic-legal depth or integrated single-surface UX. Build is wedge-agnostic at the structural level.

## 2. Tech Stack

| Layer | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend framework | **Laravel 13.x** | Single monolith for MVP. Wave-target: 13.16. |
| Admin panel | **Filament v5.x** | Wave-target: 5.6. Schema-based form API (`Schema::make()`), NOT v3's `Form::make()`. |
| Workspace panel | **Filament v5.x (second panel)** | Separate panel registered alongside admin panel. |
| Backend language | PHP 8.3 | Use modern syntax (readonly, enums, etc.) |
| Frontend (web) | Blade + Tailwind + Livewire 3 | No SPA. Server-rendered first. |
| Editor (in-document) | TipTap or CKEditor (decided in `decisions/D-02.md`) | Lives client-side, called via Livewire |
| Database | MySQL 8.x InnoDB | UTF8MB4 charset throughout |
| ORM | Eloquent | Soft deletes on tenant-scoped models only |
| Cache / queues | Redis | Cloudways managed |
| Object storage | S3-compatible | For .docx blobs, document exports |
| Cloud | Cloudways (DigitalOcean FRA1) | Region per `decisions/D-01.md` |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | `.github/workflows/` |
| Auth (web) | Google OAuth via Socialite | Session cookies, `web` guard |
| Auth (admin) | **Email + password via `admin` guard** | Session-based, distinct cookie (`platform_admin_session`), path-scoped to `/admin`, SameSite=Strict. **NOT Sanctum tokens.** |
| Auth (API) | Laravel Sanctum | Bearer tokens. **Workspace users only — never admins.** |
| API style | REST + OpenAPI 3.0 | Source of truth: `openapi/spec.yaml`. **Admin panel introduces zero public REST endpoints.** |
| LLM provider | Anthropic Claude (default) or per `decisions/D-03.md` | Abstracted behind `LlmProvider` interface |
| Billing | **Stripe direct SDK** (NOT Laravel Cashier) | Custom subscription lifecycle. Stripe API version pinned to `2025-08-27.acacia` in `config/services.php`. Webhooks idempotent via `stripe_webhook_events` ledger. |
| Tests | **Pest 4.x** | Wave-target: 4.7. `tests/Unit/`, `tests/Feature/`, `tests/Browser/`. PHPUnit syntax not acceptable. |
| E2E tests | Pest Browser Plugin (Playwright) | For editor + .docx round-trip especially. Also RTL snapshot tests. |
| Static analysis | Larastan level 6 | `phpstan.neon` |
| Code style | Laravel Pint | `pint.json` |
| Localization | Laravel localization | `resources/lang/{ar,en}/*.php`. **Key structure parity enforced.** |
| Default locale | `ar` (Arabic, RTL) | `en` is secondary, equal-weight at UI level |

## 4. Architectural Non-Negotiables

These are constraints, not preferences. **Do not violate them.** If a task seems to require violating one, stop and surface the conflict.

### Tenant-scoped (workspace) entities

1. **Workspace scoping is mandatory for tenant-scoped entities.** Every tenant-scoped model uses the `BelongsToWorkspace` trait. Every query is automatically scoped via a global Eloquent scope. Cross-workspace data leakage is a P0 bug class. **Exception: platform-level entities** (see rule 12 below).
2. **Policy + FormRequest on every write endpoint.** No exceptions. No inline validation. No `if ($user->role === ...)` checks in controllers.
3. **Soft deletes on tenant-scoped entities.** Every tenant-scoped model uses `SoftDeletes`. Hard delete only via explicit admin tooling. **Append-only ledger tables and platform-level entities are exempt** (see rules 11 and 12).
4. **Audit columns everywhere.** `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by_id`, `updated_by_id` on every tenant entity.
5. **Optimistic locking on concurrent edits.** Compare `updated_at` on update; reject HTTP 409 if mismatch.

### Cross-cutting

6. **OpenAPI spec sync.** Every public API endpoint added/changed updates `openapi/spec.yaml` in the same PR. CI enforces. **Admin-panel work does NOT touch `openapi/spec.yaml`** (admin panel is browser-only Livewire/Filament, not REST).
7. **Bilingual via Laravel localization only.** Never hardcode user-facing strings. Always `__('domain.key')`. **Enforced by `NoHardcodedStringsTest` for every domain folder.**
8. **No N+1.** Lists use eager loading. Larastan rule enforces (`larastan/larastan` baseline).
9. **No raw SQL in app code** unless wrapped in a Repository with a corresponding integration test.
10. **Document editing is client-side.** Server stores editor JSON state + .docx blob; the editor library runs in the browser. AI calls go through the backend, never browser → LLM provider directly.

### Ledgers, invariants, secrets, scope, locale (SURGE-14 additions)

11. **Cursor pagination only.** No `paginate()` (offset). All list/index endpoints — public API, admin Filament resources, internal services — use Laravel cursor pagination. Offset pagination is a defect.
12. **Append-only ledger tables.** The following are append-only: `admin_activity_log`, `subscription_events`, `stripe_webhook_events`, `admin_impersonation_sessions`. For each: no `updated_at` column, no soft deletes, no Filament Edit/Delete actions, no policy methods for update/delete. Corrections via new offsetting rows only.
13. **Platform-level entities are NOT workspace-scoped.** `AdminUser`, `AdminActivityLog`, `Plan`, `Subscription` (the subscription record itself, owned by a workspace but written/managed by platform admins), `subscription_events`, `stripe_webhook_events`, `admin_impersonation_sessions` are platform-level. They do NOT use `BelongsToWorkspace`. They live in `app/Models/` without the trait.
14. **Defense-in-depth for critical invariants.** Last-super-admin-must-exist, single-active-timer-per-user (Year-2 feature), single-active-impersonation-per-admin, and similar invariants are enforced at THREE layers: FormRequest validation + Policy method + Pest test asserting database-level invariant. All three layers must exist; any one alone is insufficient.
15. **No secrets in audit payloads.** `password`, `password_confirmation`, `new_password`, `current_password`, Stripe webhook secrets, Stripe API keys, Sanctum tokens — none of these appear in any audit log row, console log, error report, queue job argument, or Stripe webhook event row. Enforced by `AuditLogPasswordLeakageTest`.
16. **Auth guard isolation.** Three guards: `web` (workspace session), `admin` (admin panel session), `sanctum` (workspace API tokens). They do not cross-authenticate. `AdminUser` model NEVER uses `HasApiTokens` trait. `User` model can use `HasApiTokens` (workspace users authenticate the API via Sanctum). Session cookies are path-scoped and distinct.
17. **Localization key parity.** `resources/lang/ar/*.php` and `resources/lang/en/*.php` must have identical key structures. Enforced by `LocaleKeyParityTest` in CI.
18. **Stripe webhook idempotency.** Every Stripe webhook is recorded in `stripe_webhook_events` keyed on `stripe_event_id` BEFORE any side effect. Replays no-op. Signature verification non-negotiable.

## 7. Domain Glossary

The product's bounded context. When in doubt about a noun, this is the canonical meaning.

### Tenant-scoped entities (firm-facing)

- **Workspace** — A tenant. Every tenant-scoped entity belongs to exactly one workspace. Users can belong to multiple workspaces.
- **WorkspaceMember** — A user's role within a specific workspace (Owner / Admin / Member). Stored in the pivot.
- **User** — A workspace user. Authenticates via `web` guard (session) or `sanctum` (API). Distinct from `AdminUser`.
- **Role (workspace)** — Owner, Admin, Member. Three values. No more at MVP. (Distinct from admin roles below.)
- **Contact** — A person or organization. Polymorphic. Can be flagged as Client and/or Counterparty.
- **Client** — A Contact with `is_client = true`. Represented by us.
- **Counterparty** — A Contact with `is_counterparty = true`. The other side of a deal.
- **Matter** — A piece of legal work for a Client. Commercial scope only. **Has NO court fields.** Title, Client, Counterparty(s), Status, Stage, Practice Area, Notes.
- **Document** — A working artifact tied to a Matter. Most commonly a contract. Has versions, clauses, optional contract metadata.
- **DocumentVersion** — A snapshot of a Document at a point in time. Immutable once created. Every save creates a new version.
- **DocumentClause** — A structural addressable unit within a DocumentVersion. Extracted on save by `ClauseExtractionService`.
- **ContractMetadata** — One-to-one with Document where `document_type = 'contract'`. Carries value, currency, dates, term, governing law.
- **Obligation** — A dated commitment derived from a contract. Has type, responsible party, due date, status. Drives reminder emails.
- **LibraryClause** — A reusable clause in the workspace's Clause Library. May have AR + EN paired bodies. May be marked as a fallback of another clause (the playbook).
- **AiInteraction** — An audit row for every AI call. Carries prompt, response, model, tokens, cost, accepted/rejected flag.

### Platform-level entities (admin-facing, SURGE-14)

- **AdminUser** — Platform operator. Distinct from `User` (workspace user). Authenticates via `admin` guard. Has one of four roles: `super_admin`, `support`, `finance`, `read_only`. NEVER uses Sanctum tokens. Never workspace-scoped.
- **AdminActivityLog** — Append-only audit ledger of every admin-side action. PDPL Article 13 accountability surface. Read-democratically (all admin roles can view all rows).
- **Plan** — A subscription tier. Three plans at launch: `starter` ($20/seat USD), `pro` ($25/seat USD), `enterprise` ($30/seat USD). Each carries per-seat USD price, caps (seats, storage, matters, contacts), and `features` (JSON flags).
- **Subscription** — A workspace's subscription record. Owned by a workspace but managed by platform admins via the Stripe direct SDK. Five lifecycle states: `trial` (14 days, no card) → `active` → `past_due` (7-day grace) → `suspended` → `cancelled` (14 days total). Mirrored to Stripe via the SDK.
- **SubscriptionEvent** — Append-only entry in the subscription lifecycle ledger. Event types include `trial_started`, `activated`, `payment_failed`, `past_due_entered`, `suspended`, `cancelled`, `plan_changed`, `seats_changed`.
- **StripeWebhookEvent** — Append-only idempotency ledger for Stripe webhooks. Keyed on `stripe_event_id` (unique). Records signature verification result + processing outcome.
- **AdminImpersonationSession** — Append-only record of an admin impersonating a workspace user. Carries start/end timestamps, IP address, audit purpose, terminating event (timeout / explicit / forced).

### Subscription state machine

```
   ┌─────────────┐
   │   trial     │  (14d, no card required)
   └──────┬──────┘
          │ first successful payment

          │ payment fails                    │

   ┌─────────────┐  ────────────────────────┘
   │  past_due   │  (7-day grace)
   └──────┬──────┘
          │ grace expires
          ▼
   ┌─────────────┐
   │  suspended  │  (read-only via BlockSuspendedWorkspace mw)
   └──────┬──────┘
          │ 7 more days (14 days total in degraded state)
          ▼
   ┌─────────────┐
   │  cancelled  │  ──►  PDPL purge schedule (Wave 14.9)
   └─────────────┘
```

## 8. Localization Rules

- **Default locale is `ar`.** Anonymous visitors see Arabic unless they override via `?lang=en`.
- **Every user-facing string lives in `resources/lang/{ar,en}/<domain>.php`.** No exceptions.
- **No hard-coded user-facing strings.** Every visible string goes through `__('domain.key')`. Enforced by `NoHardcodedStringsTest` per domain folder.
- **Key parity between locales.** `ar/*.php` and `en/*.php` must have identical key structures (same keys in both, same nesting depth, same key names). Enforced by `LocaleKeyParityTest`.
- **`<html dir>` and `<html lang>` are set by `SetLocale` middleware** based on resolved locale. RTL/LTR is automatic.
- **Tailwind RTL utilities** are enabled via the official plugin. Use `ltr:` and `rtl:` variants when direction-specific styling is needed. Prefer logical properties (`ps-*`, `pe-*`, `ms-*`, `me-*`, `start-*`, `end-*`) over directional ones (`pl-*`, `pr-*`).
- **Dates** — Gregorian only at MVP. Hijri is a Year-2 backlog item.
- **Numbers** — Use Western Arabic numerals (0–9) in both locales (per Khaldoun input — Jordan legal/business context). Eastern Arabic numerals (٠–٩) is OUT of scope.
- **Currency** — USD only at MVP. Display `$1,234.56` (prefix, two decimals, comma thousands). User-locale formatting for decimal separator deferred.
- **Plurals** — Use Laravel's `trans_choice()` and `:count` placeholders. Arabic has 6 plural forms; account for all where the message is plural-sensitive.
- **AR translations are NEVER auto-generated.** Either the Product Designer's Content Spec provides them, or a key is flagged `[NEEDS-AR-TRANSLATION-REVIEW]` and routed to the lawyer advisor or a professional translator.
- **Arabic conventions:** Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), not Levantine dialect. Arabic punctuation (`،`, `؟`, `؛`), NOT Latin equivalents. Imperative verbs for action buttons. ":name" interpolation placeholders preserve Laravel syntax.
- **Mixed-direction content in documents** — paragraphs inherit their own direction via `dir="auto"` or per-block `dir` attribute from the editor's JSON state.
- **Password fields are always `dir="ltr"`** regardless of page locale (passwords mix directions and right-alignment creates input ambiguity).

## 9. Testing & Quality Gates

Every PR must pass:

1. **Pest 4.x test suite green.** All `tests/Unit/`, `tests/Feature/`, and (for affected Surges) `tests/Browser/`. PHPUnit syntax not acceptable.
2. **Pint clean.** `pint --test` returns no diffs.
3. **Larastan level 6 clean.** `phpstan analyse` returns no errors.
4. **OpenAPI spec valid + in sync.** `spectral lint openapi/spec.yaml` clean. Custom CI check: every new public route has a matching spec entry. (Admin panel routes are exempt — admin panel has no public API.)
5. **Workspace isolation tested.** For any new tenant-scoped entity, at least one test verifies cross-workspace data is invisible.
6. **Guard isolation tested.** For any Wave touching auth, at least one test asserts `web` ↔ `admin` ↔ `sanctum` guard isolation.
7. **Audit log secret leakage tested.** `AuditLogPasswordLeakageTest` runs on every CI build asserting no audit row contains password/secret keys.
8. **Locale key parity tested.** `LocaleKeyParityTest` runs on every CI build asserting `ar/*` and `en/*` lang files match in key structure.
9. **No-hardcoded-strings tested.** `NoHardcodedStringsTest` runs per domain folder.
10. **AR locale smoke test.** For any new UI-bearing Flow, at least one Browser test asserts AR-locale rendering with correct `<html dir="rtl">`.
11. **Invariant tests for critical invariants.** Where rule 14 applies (defense-in-depth), the Pest invariant test is mandatory and runs in CI.
12. **Append-only enforcement.** For ledger tables (rule 11), the Filament resource test asserts NO Create/Edit/Delete actions are registered.
13. **Test coverage gate.** ≥95% line coverage on namespaces affected by the Wave. `php artisan test --coverage --min=95` scoped to those namespaces.

**Test data hygiene:**

- Use factories (`<Entity>Factory`) for all test data. Never insert raw rows in tests.
- For shared setup, use Pest's `beforeEach()` per test file; avoid global state.
- Browser tests use real .docx fixtures from `tests/fixtures/docx/` — commit anonymized real-world contracts, not synthetic ones, for round-trip fidelity tests.
- Admin panel browser tests use snapshot baselines committed to `tests/Browser/__snapshots__/admin/`.

## 10. What NOT to Do (off-strategy + schema constraints)

### Schema-level constraints — REJECT any task that would add these

The `matters` table must NEVER contain:

- `judge_name`, `judge_id`
- `court_id`, `court_type`, `court`
- `court_case_number`, `case_number`
- `opponent_name`, `opponent_contact_id`, `opponents_lawyer`
- `representation_type`
- `region` (litigation construct — different from `governing_law` on contract_metadata, which IS allowed)

The codebase must NEVER contain:

- Migrations for `hearings`, `court_reviews`, `service_logs`, `judges`, `courts`
- Filament resources for any litigation entity
- Routes under `/litigation`, `/hearings`, `/court-*`, `/service-logs`
- A native accounting module — no `chart_of_accounts`, `journal_entries`, `trust_accounts`, `invoices` (Year-2), `receipts` (Year-2)
- A native CRM module — no `leads`, `pipelines`, `opportunities`, `deals` table (Year-2)
- A native email client — Emails are out (Year-2 might integrate Outlook/Gmail, not build)
- A native calendar module — deadlines live on Obligations (Year-2 might add calendar export)
- KPI / target tracking — out
- A form-templates / global-config engine — out (hardcoded defaults are fine)
- Workflow / automation engine — out
- Mobile app code — web only

### Append-only ledger constraints (SURGE-14)

For `admin_activity_log`, `subscription_events`, `stripe_webhook_events`, `admin_impersonation_sessions`:

- Do NOT add `updated_at` column
- Do NOT use `SoftDeletes`
- Do NOT register Filament Create / Edit / Delete actions in their Resources
- Do NOT add Policy methods for `update` or `delete`
- Do NOT add Artisan commands or one-off scripts that mutate existing rows
- Corrections happen via a new offsetting row (e.g., `admin.activity_log.correction` event referencing the prior row's id in payload)

### Guard / authentication constraints (SURGE-14)

- Do NOT add the `HasApiTokens` trait to `AdminUser`. Admin auth is session-only.
- Do NOT add Sanctum API endpoints under `/admin/*`. Admin panel is browser-only.
- Do NOT create routes that authenticate via both `web` and `admin` guards. Each route uses exactly one guard.
- Do NOT share session cookies between `web` and `admin` guards. The admin cookie is path-scoped to `/admin` with SameSite=Strict.
- Do NOT log Stripe webhook secrets, Stripe API keys, or any password/credential in any payload (audit log, console log, error report, queue job arguments).

### Operational constraints

- Do not call LLM providers directly from the browser. Always proxy through the backend.
- Do not store LLM API keys anywhere except `.env` (read via `config()`).
- Do not log prompt content unless the `AiInteraction` audit row receives it (intentional, for cost + compliance).
- Do not bypass the `BelongsToWorkspace` scope with `withoutGlobalScopes()` unless explicitly in a platform-admin context (which is rare and must be reviewed).
- Do not commit `.env` files, fixture files containing real client data, or API keys.
- Do not auto-translate Arabic strings via Google Translate / DeepL / LLM. Flag for human review.
- Do not allow the admin seeder (`AdminUserSeeder`) to fall back to hard-coded default credentials in production. Production must supply `ADMIN_SEED_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_SEED_NAME`, `ADMIN_SEED_PASSWORD` env vars or the seeder throws.

### Process constraints

- Do not begin work on a Surge whose upstream gates are not green (per SURGE-00 deliverables + prior Surge sign-off). Use the AODC_Software_Engineer agent's Gate Status Report.
- Do not skip Pest tests "just to ship faster." CI will block.
- Do not modify `CLAUDE.md` (this file) without explicit founder direction. CLAUDE.md updates happen at Surge completion, not during Waves.
- Do not modify any file under `decisions/` without an ADR-style superseding entry. ADRs are append-only.
- Do not bypass the AODC pipeline. Tasks without a Tech Task Package are surfaced back to the AODC_Software_Engineer agent.

## 11. AODC Pipeline Reference

This project is built via the AODC (Agent-Orchestrated Development Cycle) methodology. Relevant artifacts live in:

| Location | Contents |
|---|---|
| `docs/README.md` | Index + non-negotiables + naming conventions (canonical) |
| `docs/00_MVP_ROADMAP.md` | Master plan — wedge, scope, sequencing, principles |
| `docs/SURGE-NN-*.md` | Per-Surge plans — Flows, dependencies, acceptance |
| `docs/WAVE-NN.N-*.md` | Per-Wave Wave-Ready Packages |
| `docs/validation/` | SURGE-00 deliverables (PRD, AI test report, interviews) + advisor logs |
| `docs/validation/02_advisor_meeting_log.md` | Khaldoun Khater's documented decisions (source of truth for advisor input) |
| `decisions/D-NN.md` | Architecture decision records |
| `prompts/` | AI prompt templates — each requires `[LEGAL-REVIEW]` sign-off in header |
| `spikes/` | Throwaway research — deleted after the corresponding decision |

### Roles in the AODC pipeline

```
Business request  →  Wave-Ready Package  →  Tech Task Package  →  Claude Code execution
   (Founder)         (Product Designer)     (Engineer agent)      (Claude Code)
```

- **Founder (Abdullah)** — Owns product, scope, business decisions. Sole approver of Surge/Wave content.
- **Product Designer agent** — Produces Wave-Ready Packages with structured Intent, Stories, Wireframes, API Contracts, Content Spec, Edge Cases, Sign-Off.
- **Engineer agent** — Consumes Wave-Ready Packages. Produces Tech Task Packages with migrations, models, FormRequests, Policies, Filament Resources, tests.
- **Claude Code** — Reads Tech Task Packages. Writes the actual code in the repository.

**When asked to do work, expect to be given:** a Tech Task Package (TTP) produced by the Engineer agent. The TTP references the relevant Wave-Ready Package in `docs/` and contains everything you need.

**If a task arrives without a TTP** — for example, the AO pastes a free-form request directly — stop and ask: "Should this be routed through the Engineer agent first to produce a Tech Task Package?" Ad-hoc tasks bypass the gates that exist to prevent rework.

### Advisor precedence

When practitioner input (from Khaldoun Khater, lawyer advisor) conflicts with prior architectural assumptions, **advisor input takes precedence** for legal-domain questions. The advisor meeting log at `docs/validation/02_advisor_meeting_log.md` is the source of truth for these decisions. Examples already lifted to architectural rules:

- Appeal windows are court-level-dependent (10 days for Magistrate Courts, 30 days for First Instance Courts). Malpractice exposure if conflated.
- Hearing session content is gated by `status = 'held'`. Sessions in other states do not expose content.
- Trust accounting trial-ledger adjustments require explicit description (Jordanian Lawyers Act).
- ExpertReport entity has an 8-day objection countdown.
- Western numerals (0–9) in Arabic UI, not Eastern (٠–٩).

---

## 12. When in doubt

Order of precedence for resolving uncertainty:

1. **This file (`CLAUDE.md`).** If something here contradicts other documents, this wins, but flag the contradiction for the Founder.
2. **`docs/00_MVP_ROADMAP.md`.** The strategic source of truth.
3. **The specific Surge plan** for the work in question (`docs/SURGE-NN-*.md`).
4. **The Wave-Ready Package** for the Wave in question (`docs/WAVE-NN.N-*.md`).
5. **The Tech Task Package** for the Flow in question.
6. **The advisor meeting log** (`docs/validation/02_advisor_meeting_log.md`) for legal-domain questions.
7. **The Founder** (via the AO). If 1–6 do not resolve it, escalate.

Do not invent answers. Do not guess at intent. Stop, surface the question, wait for direction.

---

## 13. Public Marketing Namespace

The repository contains **two distinct surfaces** served from the same Laravel monolith:

- **Authenticated product surface** — Filament panel at `/app/*` + custom Livewire pages at `/*` (authenticated). Existing patterns apply.
- **Public marketing surface** — Blade + Tailwind landing pages at `/*` (unauthenticated, public).

The two surfaces share infrastructure (Laravel app, database, queue, cache) but use different patterns.

### File location conventions

| Layer | Path pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Public controllers | `app/Http/Controllers/Public/*` | Never mix with admin controllers |
| Public FormRequests | `app/Http/Requests/Public/*` | |
| Public middleware | `app/Http/Middleware/SetPublicLocale.php` | Prefix with `Public` if surface-specific |
| Public Blade layouts | `resources/views/public/layouts/marketing.blade.php` | SEPARATE from authenticated layout |
| Public Blade pages | `resources/views/public/*` | Mirror route name structure |
| Public Blade components | `resources/views/components/marketing/*` | Namespaced under `marketing/` |
| Public localization | `resources/lang/{en,ar}/marketing.php` | Top-level key `marketing.*` |
| Public route group | Top of `routes/web.php`, middleware `public.locale` | |
| Public API routes | `routes/api.php` under `prefix('v1/public')` | |
| Markdown content (legal) | `resources/markdown/legal/{slug}-{locale}.md` | |
| Public config | `config/marketing.php`, `config/seo.php` | Pricing, SEO defaults, founding-firm flag |

### Locale handling on the public surface

- **Default locale: English (LTR).** Arabic available at `/ar/*` route prefix.
- **Cookie:** `efirm_locale`, values `en` or `ar` only, TTL 365 days, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure=true` in production, `HttpOnly=false`.
- **Middleware:** `app/Http/Middleware/SetPublicLocale.php`, alias `public.locale`.
- **Detection priority:** `efirm_locale` cookie → `Accept-Language` header → English default.
- **Translation:** `__('marketing.{section}.{key}')` everywhere; no hard-coded strings.
- **Missing key fallback:** `Lang::fallback('en')`; missing AR keys fall back to EN with log warning to `marketing-i18n` channel.
- **RTL:** Tailwind `rtl:*` prefix utilities. Directional icons use `rtl:scale-x-[-1]`.
- **Numbers:** Western Arabic numerals (`0–9`) in both locales.
- **Fonts:** EN uses `'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif`. AR uses `'IBM Plex Sans Arabic', 'Tajawal', system-ui, sans-serif`.

### Public API conventions

- **Path prefix:** `/api/v1/public/*`. No authentication. CSRF required for browser POSTs.
- **Rate limiting:** `Limit::perMinute(60)->by($request->ip())`. Tighter per-endpoint: `throttle:5,60` for demo requests.
- **Append-only audit:** `cookie_consent_records` follows the same append-only convention as `admin_activity_log`.
- **OpenAPI spec:** Public endpoints carry `tags: ["Public", "Marketing"]` and `security: []`.

### SEO and crawlability

- **Sitemap:** `/sitemap.xml` lists every public route in both locales with `lastmod`, `changefreq: weekly`.
- **Robots:** `/robots.txt` allows all crawlers, disallows `/app/*`, references sitemap.
- **Meta tags:** Every public page must include `<title>` (≤ 60 chars), `meta description` (≤ 160 chars), canonical, OG tags, Twitter cards, `hreflang`.
- **JSON-LD:** Every public page embeds `LegalService` schema with `areaServed: ["JO","LB","PS","IQ"]`.
- **Pest enforcement:** `tests/Feature/Marketing/LandingCopyLimitsTest.php` asserts character limits. CI fails on violation.

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

- Enforced via axe-core in `tests/Browser/Marketing/AccessibilityTest.php`. CI fails on violation.
- **Landmarks:** `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` required.
- **Heading hierarchy:** One `h1` per page, sequential `h2`/`h3`. No skipped levels.
- **Skip-to-content:** Top of `<body>`, visible on Tab focus.
- **Focus indicators:** `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-slate-900 focus:ring-offset-2`.
- **Touch targets:** ≥ 44×44 CSS pixels.
- **Reduced motion:** Disable transitions/animations > 200ms when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

### Cookie consent (PDPL Article 13)

- Banner shown when `efirm_consent` cookie is absent.
- **Cookie format:** JSON `{"essential":true,"analytics":bool,"marketing":bool,"timestamp":"ISO8601"}`, max 256 bytes, 365-day TTL.
- **GA4 gating:** `window['ga-disable-{GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID}'] = true` unless `analytics: true` in cookie. IP anonymisation enforced.
- **Audit trail:** Every consent writes to `cookie_consent_records` via `POST /api/v1/public/cookie-consent`. Append-only.
- **Re-consent:** Footer link "Cookie Settings" / "إعدادات ملفات تعريف الارتباط" reopens the modal.

### Legal pages (stubs)

- **Location:** `resources/markdown/legal/{slug}-{locale}.md` — `terms`, `privacy`, `dpa`, `ai-disclaimer` × `en`, `ar` = 8 files.
- **Rendering:** `LegalController@show` reads slug + locale, renders through `resources/views/public/legal/show.blade.php`.
- **Disclaimer banner:** Every legal page MUST display persistent amber-100 banner: *"This document is a stub pending final legal review."* Removal only after founder approval in `docs/validation/02_advisor_meeting_log.md`.

### New database tables

| Table | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `demo_requests` | Standard CRUD | UUID PK, indexed on email + created_at. NOT append-only. |
| `cookie_consent_records` | Append-only | Joins `admin_activity_log` + `subscription_events` family. |

### New environment variables (production + staging)

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | Linear personal API token |
| `LINEAR_TEAM_ID` | Linear team UUID |
| `LINEAR_LEADS_PROJECT_ID` | Linear "Leads" project UUID |
| `GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` | Google Analytics 4 measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`) |
| `MAIL_LEAD_NOTIFICATION` | Demo-request notification recipient (default `abdullah@efirm.io`) |

### New queue + integration

- **Queue:** `demo_requests`. Job: `CreateLinearLeadTicketJob` (3 retries, exponential backoff 30/60/120s). Failure does not block visitor.
- **Linear:** `app/Services/Integrations/LinearClient.php`. GraphQL at `https://api.linear.app/graphql`. Auth via `LINEAR_API_KEY`. Failure logged to `linear-integration` channel; visitor experience never blocked.

### Marketing-surface non-negotiables

1. **No raw strings in marketing Blade.** All user-facing strings from `resources/lang/{en,ar}/marketing.php`. Exception: S-7 Arabic AI Demo content renders as static in both locales.
2. **No analytics without consent.** GA4 gated by `efirm_consent` cookie. Unconditional loading is a PDPL Article 13 violation.
3. **Persistent legal-stub disclaimer.** Every legal page shows disclaimer until founder approves removal in `docs/validation/02_advisor_meeting_log.md`.
4. **Khaldoun pre-launch gate.** First public DNS cutover requires Khaldoun's written sign-off (48h before cutover). S-7 Arabic AI Demo + S-8 Jordanian procedural claims must be practitioner-validated.
